# The No-God Protocol

**A Manifesto for Post-Ideological Civilization**  
Version 0.1 – Published by SecularNet

> “This is not a religion.  
> This is not a rebellion.  
> This is a firewall.”

This document is a call for rational, secular, ethical civilization design—decentralized, anonymous, and uncorrupted by faith-based systems.

## 🔓 Principles
- The individual is sovereign
- Truth exists, and must be discovered—not declared
- Freedom of speech is sacred
- No belief is above criticism

## 🧱 Structure
See `NoGodProtocol_v0.1.md` for the full manifesto.

## 📡 Mirrors

- Planned: IPFS, QR tools, and zine-style PDF

Fork it. Translate it. Defend it.
